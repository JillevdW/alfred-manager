## Key Features

* Export Alfred Custom Web Searches
* Import Alfred Custom Web Searches
* For Engineers: a great place to contribute to a new SwiftUI project :)

## How To Use

- Download the application from the [releases](https://github.com/JillevdW/alfred-manager/releases) page and run it.
- Select your Alfred preferences path.
- Either
	- select the Web Searches you want to export
	- OR locate the configuration file for the Web Searches you want to import and select the Web Searches you want to import.

## Architecture

The app is built using SwiftUI for the UI and a simple ViewModel pattern to manage updates to the state. [Factory](https://github.com/hmlongco/Factory) is used to inject dependencies into the ViewModels.

### Reservations
I'm not 100% happy about the state of the code, here's a short outline of some reservations I have to get a discussion going on those topics.
#### Containers
Factory uses Containers to manage the dependencies. I've (unsuccessfully) attempted to create a hierarchical structure with these containers, to make "Child" containers automatically be able to provide dependencies already present in a "Parent" (much like with [Needle](https://github.com/uber/needle)). I ended up dropping this attempt, but some left-over code remains: for example the `InstallationSelectionContainer` referencing a dependency from the `RootViewContainer`. This has proven to be an annoyance during testing and in it's current state isn't scalable.


## Contributing

Feel free to submit a pull request with new features or improvements. That's why the project is public! Some starting points could be:
- Unifying the selection logic in `WebSearchImportViewModel` and `WebSearchExportViewModel` to reduce duplication.
	- After this, both these ViewModels could use some tests ðŸ˜‡
- Error handling is non-existent in almost all views.
	- Tip: For simple Views, a pattern where a simple ViewModel updates a State enum (similar to what happens in `RootView` and `RootViewModel`) is often enough and easily testable.
